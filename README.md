## Getting and Cleaning Data - Week 4 Assignment
This is my submission for the week 4 assignment in the course "Getting and Cleaning Data". It contains:
- run_analysis.R: the code that transform and outputs the data according to the assignment guidelines.
- codebook.md: a codebook describing the changes and transformations applied over the data.
- tidy_data.txt: the output data of the assignment.

In order to replicate the project, the code run_analysis.R must be run. If the input data is not present in your working directory, it will download it and unzip it. Otherwise, it will omit this step.

After the code is succesfully run, you should get an exact replica of the tidy_data.txt file attached in this repository.
